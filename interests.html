            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>I have been learning to code on my own for a number of years but decided to head back to school in the summer of 2021 to make it a more formal affair. I have really been enjoying my classes so far at <a href="https://www.dmacc.edu">DMACC</a>.
                My favorite project to date has been from my intro Python course. I have been using Python for a while and my final project gave me an excuse to really push myself.</p>
            <p>Here's the demo video:</p>

            <div class="m-tb">

            <h2>Extra Life</h2>
            <p>Once a year I do a charity fundraiser for Children’s Miracle Network hospitals through and organization called <a href=”https://www.extra-life.org/”>Extra Life</a>. I have been leading a team that pledges to play games for 24 hours and we
                ask friends and family to sponsor us. Over the past nine years, my team and I have raised nearly $15,000 that goes directly to the hospitals to fund research, provide needed equipment and also provide uncompensated care.</p>
            <p> You can see a past recording from one of our bouns events here:</p>

            <h2>PC Building</h2>
            <p>I have been building PC’s ever since I found out I could strip my old IBM Aptiva down for parts and update most of the components. I build various levels of PC’s from budget builds using whatever parts I can scrape together to new custom builds
                for myself and friends. I also use raspberry Pi’s for experimentation and small projects. I currently have my garage lights running off a Raspberry Pi 3 that can turn on automatically when I open our side door or via a local webapp. </p>

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>When I was a younger man I had the opportunity to travel. I was able to take a couple trips to Scotland and one to Ireland. I’ve also been camping in Canada, I spent my honeymoon in Maui and did some haggling in Mexico. I would like to travel
                again once my children are grown and I have a little more time (and money) to spare.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>I’ve always been one to get my hands dirty and I love to work on various types of projects from cars, to construction. From fences to foundations, there isn’t much I wont try my hand at. </p>
