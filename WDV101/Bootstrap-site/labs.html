                <h3>Labs Are Highly Intelligent</h3>
                <p>Due to their high intelligence as a breed, people in need can benefit from Labradors’ services in different fields. They are well known as ideal guide dogs for the disabled or the blind. When appropriately trained, they can also make excellent
                    guard dogs. They can hear something as faint as a pin drop from a distance. Also, Labs have an exceptional sniffing ability. Their services are also famous for recovering bodies after a natural disaster, finding a missing person, and
                    detecting various drugs and explosives.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>They Have Wonderful Temperaments</h3>
                <p>Labradors are handy, friendly, and well-balanced dogs, adaptable to a wide variety of functions as well as making good pets. Labs are not overly prone to moping, hypersensitivity, insecurity, or aggression. They have an excellent reputation
                    for being an even-tempered breed and a perfect family dog.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h3>Labradors Are Easy to Train</h3>
                <p>Every dog needs training if it’s to become a member of the family. Certain dog breeds are hard to train, but Labradors require less energy and effort to train than most. They are quick learners and quite intelligent. Therefore, proper
                    and complete training requires less time, and if you are hiring a dog trainer, it will save on your pocketbook. Even first-time dog owners find it easy to train a Labrador. Known for being very food-driven dogs, you will find out how
                    well behaved your Lab can be when you have a tasty treat in your hand.</p>

                <h3>Labradors Are Loving Dogs</h3>
                <p>If you look into a Lab’s eyes, you will see that it looks at you with pure love. When she sits close to you and looks at you, you can tell that she is thinking about how much she loves you. When Labs are tired, hurt, or scared, and you're
                    there with them, you'll see how thankful they are to have you nearby. They are also delighted to see their owner when you come home.</p>

                    are always ready to chase you around for hours and still want more.</p>
