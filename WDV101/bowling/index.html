                    <p class="col-sm-12">Come visit us for the grand opening of the <em>Strike 'n Spare</em>, our newest eatery here at Lana Lanes. We've served up a 50's style menu for you, complete with the best burgers and fries this side of the Mississippi. We've got
                        malts and shakes in every flavor, as long as you ask for chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, that is. All of our burgers are made from Texas prime beef, and our burgers are at least 90% lean. We cook our burgers well done over
                        a flaming grill to give you that great seared taste of the Great Plains best burger. If you choose to skip the burger, then try our salad bar on for size. We've got a soup, salad, and breadstick combo platter that's sure to please.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-12">Our summer spectacular continues with great music every Friday and Saturday night. Come dance in the <em>Tailfin Lounge</em>, where each week you can dance to some of the best sounds of the 50's. You've got your chance to sing karaoke
                        on Wednesday nights, should you be in the mood to sing some of the best hits of the 50's. All of our seats are trimmed with chrome and real vinyl, so you'll be in the mood to stroll down memory lane with us any night of the week.</p>

                        admission to the Tailfin Lounge.</p>
