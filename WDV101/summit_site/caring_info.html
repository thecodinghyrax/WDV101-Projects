        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Alaskan Huskies are a very energetic and playful breed. They are used to getting excessive amounts of
            exercise which make them a challenging breed to keep for most average families. They are great exercise
            partners and love to accompany people while jogging or bicycling. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Without the proper amount of fresh air and exercise most Alaskan Huskies will develop less than desirable
            social traits. As a breed, they are playful, independent and very social. They tend to run off in public and
            will need to be restrained on a leash. This breed of dog needs a moderate amount of care which mostly
            consists of exercising them enough.</p>

        <h2>Traning</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Alaskan Huskies benefit greatly from early training programs. They tend to be independent thinkers, but we'll
            follow a strong pack leader. These Huskies should be contained in yards with very large fences as they are
            known to have great jumping abilities. They also respond well to playful activities such as tug of war, sled
            pulling, fetch and hiking.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Grooming</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Huskies are bred for cold climates and as such they have very thick coats. They should be brushed one to two
            times per week to keep shedding at a minimum. Grooming can be a constant chore with these dogs and great
            care must be taken to prevent them from overheating when the weather becomes warm.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Health</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Alaskan Huskies tend to be very hearty dogs assuming they get enough exercise and proper nutrition. An
            average Alaskan Husky male can weigh from 40 to 60 pounds with females weighing anywhere from 35 to 48
            pounds. Their general lifespan is between 10 and 16 years</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>

        <br>

        <p> Premium dry dog food that has plenty of carbohydrates vitamins minerals and animal proteins are considered
            best for Alaskan Huskies. Some owners choose to feed them plenty of fresh meats, eggs and other protein rich
            sources. This is an ideal diet but can be cost prohibitive. Poor quality dog food typically does not have
            the proper nutrients that Alaskan Huskies will need to maintain proper health.</p>
